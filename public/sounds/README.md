# Custom Sound Files

Place your custom sound files in this directory to use them in the app.

## Required Files:

1. **theme.mp3** - Bar Feud Theme music
2. **buzzer.wav** - Buzzer sound effect
3. **correct.wav** - Correct answer sound effect

## Instructions:

Copy your sound files from:
- `C:\Users\chris\Music\Bar Feud Sounds\Bar Feud Theme.mp3` → Rename to `theme.mp3`
- `C:\Users\chris\Music\Bar Feud Sounds\buzzer.wav` → Keep as `buzzer.wav`
- `C:\Users\chris\Music\Bar Feud Sounds\correct.wav` → Keep as `correct.wav`

Place them in this `public/sounds/` directory.

## Optional Sound Files:

You can also add these for a complete sound experience:
- wrong.mp3 or wrong.wav
- strike.mp3 or strike.wav
- reveal.mp3 or reveal.wav

The app will automatically use these files when they exist in this directory.
